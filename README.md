# About

This is the source code for the web site [www.1maiprogram.no](https://www.1maiprogram.no/)
which is a site where it super simple to find links to
[labour day programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day)
in the kommune in Norway you live in.

All links have a year component so you will never be given outdated information.

## Technology

This is a standard [Angular project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ata9cSC2WpM),
currently using [Angular version 20](https://angular.dev/).

The links are stored in a [Supabase Postgres database](https://supabase.com/).
